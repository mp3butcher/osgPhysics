osgPhysics objectives
---------------------

1. Support for more plugins: Bullet, Newton, PAL...

2. Supoprt for soft bodies (with an example)

3. Physics updating in a separated thread

4. Physics simulation on terrain and paged nodes

5. Create some more complex examples
Ideas:
	- A Newton's cradle (only "good" engines can do it - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_cradle). The scene is simple but involves complex collisions.
	- A ragdoll test (a ragdoll falling down in a pit with some obstacles?). PAL already has a ragdoll example.
	- A moving robot. This involves complex joints hirearchies, joint constraints (joint angular limits for instance), and motors.
	- An example that shows how to make use of internal physics engines' objects (getPhysicsData()).
	- An example that shows all possible user interactions in a physics simulation.

6. Improvements, bug fixes and tests...
